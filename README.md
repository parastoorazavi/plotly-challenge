### üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Everyday, Data Science and Machine Learning teams rely on Plotly for creating beautiful analytic apps included Interactive charts and maps.
Plotly provides online graphing, analytics, and statistics tools for individuals and collaboration, as well as scientific graphing libraries for Python, R, Javascript and ..
In this project, we will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
